#AlphaFold Tutorial using ColabFold
Welcome to the AlphaFold tutorial where we will use a modified version of ColabFold to predict protein folding structures using AlphaFold2 and MMseqs2. This tutorial is designed to help you gain a deeper understanding of the protein folding prediction process, and to enable you to predict protein structures with ease using ColabFold.

## Introduction
ColabFold is a protein folding prediction tool based on Google DeepMind's AlphaFold and utilizes MMseqs2 for sequence alignments and templates. With ColabFold, you can easily predict the protein folding structure based on the amino acid sequence.

## Running the Tutorial
The tutorial is a Jupyter notebook that can be run on Google Colab. To run each cell, press Shift + Enter while inside the cell or press the triangular play button above. There will be questions included throughout the workshop to help you gain a deeper understanding of what you are calculating.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this workshop, you will be able to:

* Describe how to use ColabFold to predict protein structures.
* Explain and interpret the results generated using ColabFold.
* Use ColabFold to predict the protein structure of any specific protein of interest.
